#Laravel Vuetify SPA Starter Pack

This is a complete starter pack to get you up and running with a Vue-based SPA (Single Page Application) including authentication, Google Analytics integration, optional ReCaptcha Integration, and an API interface to use Laravel route names from within the Vue code itself. 

This is designed to be a simple, easy-to-use package for most users and does not have much for state management (we don't use Vuex in this project.) If you are looking for a package for a large, complicated app, this may not be the right starter pack for you.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your project folder. Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org) to install the PHP/Laravel dependencies and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install the JavaScript dependencies.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
